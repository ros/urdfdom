  <description brief="This package allows you to publish the state of a robot to the transform library topic">

    This package allows you to publish the state of a robot to the transform library topic. Once the state
    gets published, it is available to all components in the system using the transform library.
    The package takes the joint angles of the robot as input and publishes the 3D poses 
    of the robot links, using a kinematic tree model of the robot. The package can both be used
    as a library and as a ROS node.
